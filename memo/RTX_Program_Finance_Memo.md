RTX Program Finance Valuation Memo
Raytheon-Style Risk-Adjusted Valuation & Sector Context Review
Prepared By: Max Taylor
Project Type: Capital Markets & Program Finance Hybrid Analysis
Objective: Determine whether RTX is currently overvalued, undervalued, or fairly priced relative to internal cash flow drivers, sector benchmarks, and risk-adjusted assumptions.
1. Executive Summary
RTX trades at levels that appear fundamentally fair given backlog visibility, operating margin profile, and sector risk.
DCF results converge near current pricing under realistic assumptions, with upside dependent on operational improvement rather than market dislocation.
Recommendation: Hold / Fairly Valued
Status: Does not screen as materially undervalued
2. Analytical Approach
Component	Method Used
Base Valuation Model	5-year DCF with terminal value (WACC vs perpetual growth)
Risk Adjustments	FX volatility, cost escalation, supply chain margin pressure
Peer Validation	EV/EBITDA, P/FCF, revenue CAGR comps vs LMT, GD, NOC
Market Cross-Check	RTX vs ITA and RTX vs peers price trend charts
Sensitivity Testing	+/– 100 bps WACC, +/– 50 bps margin shift, FX shock testing
This structure simulates the decision framework used in capital markets and defense program finance.
3. Key Findings
Base Case – Current Pricing Justified
Metric	Result
NPV	Positive; clusters near current price
IRR	Exceeds hurdle; not asymmetric
Margin Outlook	Stable but not expanding without execution improvement
Upside Case – Dependent on Internal Improvement
Driver	Impact
Margin expansion + backlog acceleration	Increases implied value
Lower risk premium (WACC compression)	Drives valuation lift
Sector re-rating	Not currently implied by fundamentals
Downside Case – Risk from Costs & Cycle Exposure
Driver	Impact
Cost escalation in supply base	Compresses program margins
Contracting / DoD cycle normalization	Reduces backlog confidence
FX volatility	Pressure to hedged & unhedged exposures
4. Peer Benchmarking (Positioning Check)
Company	EV/EBITDA	P/FCF	5Y Revenue CAGR	Market Signal
RTX	19.6x	N/A	11.9%	Fairly Valued
LMT	18.1x	N/A	8.8%	In-line
GD	15.8x	N/A	10.6%	Slight Discount
NOC	14.8x	N/A	4.3%	Value Option
ITA (ETF)	—	—	—	Sector Baseline
Conclusion: RTX does not screen as the discount or the premium — it sits middle of the pack.
5. Decision Framework
Realistically, RTX is:
Not mispriced enough to call undervalued
Not degraded enough to call overpriced
Positioned neutrally with sector-consistent expectations
A hiring manager or capital allocator would likely classify this as:
“Fairly Valued with Conditional Upside.”
6. Final Determination & Recommended Stance
View	Position
Capital Markets (investment perspective)	Hold / Fair Value
Program Finance (internal decisioning)	Proceed with caution; hedging + cost controls required
FP&A / Strategy Viewpoint	Monitor inputs: margins, cost base, WACC spread
Actionable Notes if This Were a Real Mandate
Improve hedge discipline (EUR/USD + GBP/USD exposures)
Renegotiate escalation clauses proactively
Re-source vulnerable suppliers
